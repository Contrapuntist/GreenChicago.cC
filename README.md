# GreenChicago.cC 

## Purpose 

How does one easily live a sustainable lifestyle in Chicago? Although resources exists, they are sporatic and isolated. This app seeks to create a centralized resource to enable residents within Chicago to find resources like electric vehicle charging stations, farmers markets, parks and more in a single location.  

## Functionality Summary:

* On page load, pending browser settings, app will pinpoint user location (or be asked)
* Zip search is limited to Chicago zips only. (60601 or 60614 as a couple of good examples to change point of reference.)
* The menu on the left will retrieve data and add markers on Google map
* Each data set has a custom pin
* Each data marker will show an info window on click displaying data for that location, which is dynamically added to each marker on data load.
* Weather is real-time and based on either Chicago or user location(not what I worked on, so  I donâ€™t recall exactly).
